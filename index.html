        What is Lorem Ipsum?<br>
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer <br>took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived<br> not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining <br>essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br>Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including <br>versions of Lorem Ipsum
